## I will use the Rails 5 feature called ActionCable to build one without using any front-end framework (expect jQuery – but it’s just a light library). My goal is to create a real time Rails chat application that sends and shows messages to a recipient instantly without any page refresh.

### Following are the features of the app:

* start a new conversation

* send a basic message

* real time messages

* new message notifications


The basic idea is to learn new Rails 5 exciting feature, Action Cable and Web Sockets Support.
